terraform {
  # At the root of a layer (ie, the directory where "terraform apply" is run),
  # best practice is to specify an exact version of Terraform to use. Use the
  # "= 1.2.3" constraint to do this.
  #
  # In a module, you can allow more flexibility with regards to Terraform's
  # minor and/or patch versions. For example, the "~> 1.0" constraint will allow
  # all 1.x.x versions of Terraform, while the "~> 1.0.0" constraint will allow
  # all 1.0.x versions.
  #
